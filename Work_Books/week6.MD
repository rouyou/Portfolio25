# Data Handling and Programming Tasks Workbook

This workbook provides hands-on experience with essential data handling and programming tasks. By completing the exercises, I gained practical skills in Python, Pandas, and data visualization, which are critical for a data technician role.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Programming Skills:**
   - Demonstrated proficiency in implementing logic (e.g., FizzBuzz) and data manipulation using Python.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Practiced loading, exploring, manipulating, and visualizing datasets using Pandas and Matplotlib.
   - Applied these skills to analyze student performance and GDP data, preparing for real-world data technician roles.

## Real-World Application: Key Takeaways

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Null values can significantly impact analysis and must be handled appropriately (removal, filling, or replacement).
