# SQL Tasks for Data Analysis

This document outlines a series of SQL tasks designed to analyze data from the world database. Each task focuses on specific scenarios, such as demographic analysis, global health initiatives, travel promotions, and urban planning. Below is a concise summary of the tasks, their objectives, and the SQL queries used.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Understanding Business Requirements**
   - **Data to Store:** Identifying the necessary data for analysis.
   - **User Needs:** Addressing the specific needs of end-users.

2. **Designing the Database Schema**
   - **Table Structure:** Defining the structure of tables.
   - **Relationships Between Tables:** Establishing how tables relate to one another.

3. **Implementing the Database**
   - **SQL Commands for Table Creation:** Writing SQL commands to create tables.
   - **Defining Relationships:** Establishing relationships between tables using SQL.

4. **Populating the Database**
   - **Inserting Initial Data:** Adding data to the tables.

5. **Maintaining the Database**
   - **Ensuring Accuracy and Security:** Keeping the database accurate and secure.

6. **SQL Practical**

## Real-World Applications

These SQL tasks demonstrate practical applications of database querying in real-world scenarios. By leveraging SQL's powerful features, we can efficiently extract meaningful insights from large datasets, supporting decision-making across various domains like healthcare, urban planning, and education.

### Example Queries

- **Demographic Analysis:**
  ```sql
  SELECT country.Name, city.Name, city.Population
  FROM city
  JOIN country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code
  WHERE city.Population > 1000000
  ORDER BY city.Population DESC;
